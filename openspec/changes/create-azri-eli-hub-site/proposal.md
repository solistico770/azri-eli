## Why
עזרי-אלי needs a simple landing page to serve as the hub for the religious community in the Azrieli complex. The page will direct visitors to the digital bulletin board and WhatsApp updates group.

## What Changes
- Create a single-page Hebrew (RTL) landing page at `index.html`
- Include the logo with colorful dome design
- Display hero section with community tagline
- Show two feature sections (bulletin board & WhatsApp group)
- Add CTA button linking to resources
- Configure meta tags for professional WhatsApp link previews
- Initialize git repository and push to GitHub
- Deploy to Vercel
- Configure GoDaddy DNS to point azri-eli.org to Vercel

## Impact
- Affected specs: `landing-page` (new capability)
- Affected code: `index.html` (new file), logo asset
- Infrastructure: GitHub repo, Vercel project, GoDaddy DNS
